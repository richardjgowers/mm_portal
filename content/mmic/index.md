# What is MMIC?
The Molecular Mechanics Interoperable Components (MMIC) project provides a standard for input and output of MM programs by defining the scientific and computational stages of classical MM pipelines, but leaving the implementation up to the developer/user. MMIC attempts to define the “what” of scientific stages without restricting the “how” i.e. MMIC defines only the input and output the implementation must conform to so that end-users can swap out different implementations with minimal effort in their existing pipelines, or workflow tools of their choice.


# What are MM components?
Components in the MMIC world behave like structured "boxes" with a common API. Each component has well-defined input and output schemas, with complete unawareness of other components used in the workflow.

Each component does internal data validation to ensure the input and output models are compliant with the specified schemas. Using any component requires a single class method to be invoked:

{{< code language="python" line-numbers="false">}}
from mmpkg import Component
output_model = Component.compute(input_model) 
{{< /code >}}


The MMIC package is written in python. The design and component types in MMIC are discussed in the next 2 sections.

# Component design
All components in MMIC are subclasses of [ProgramHarness](https://github.com/MolSSI/mmic/blob/main/mmic/components/base/base_component.py#L8), which is the most fundamental component in MMIC. This class
performs data validation and program execution, and it provides input/output classmethods that return the models associated with the component schemas. Since all components have the same API, using any of 
them implies invoking a single classmethod (`Component.compute`) which internally does the schema validation for the input model, instantiates the component object, calls `Component.execute` method 
that returns the output model, which is finally validated before it is returned to the calling process. This is summarized in the flowchart below for the 
`Component.compute` method.

There are several types of subclasses of `ProgramHarness` which are discussed in the next section. For more information on the MMIC design, see the online <a href="https://github.com/MolSSI/MMIC">documentation</a>. 
To learn about how components are designed in practice, see the "getting started" [tutorial](/tutorials/getting_started).

# Component types
There are 3 distinct and general types of *blueprint* components that could be used when designing a new component in MMIC. 
The 1st type is `GenericComponent`, which as the name implies, is meant for general-purpose usage. The input/output schemas in this component are `ProtoModel`.
The 2nd type is `StrategyComponent` which does not perform any scientific tasks. Instead, this component defines input/output classmethods that specify (scientific) schemas specific to an application area 
(e.g. energy minimization, molecular dynamics, normal mode analysis, etc.). The main task of a `StrategyComponent` is to discover and run a compatible `TacticComponent` (3rd type) that must comply with 
input/output schemas provided by `StrategyComponent`. Therefore, `TacticComponent` is tailored to a particular code in an application area (e.g. OpenMM energy minimization, NAMD molecular dynamics, 
GROMACS normal mode analysis, etc.).

The main objective behind this design is to provide an easy and intuitive way of handling common (but not universal) features available in different MM codes. 
If *feature1* is requested in a workflow, and this feature is available in *MM code1* but not in *MM code2*, `StrategyComponent` runs the execution with a `TacticComponent` that supports *MM code1*. 
`StrategyComponent` therefore automates the runtime selection and execution of an available and compatible `TacticComponent`, enabling a higher level of abstraction.
